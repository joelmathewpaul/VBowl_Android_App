## Target Users :
* The app targets working professionals, students and potential employers (16+)

## Slogan :
* Connecting professional peers
* Where professionals connect
* Share, Discover, Connect.

## Other Questions about our app
* The app aims to connect event-goers with fellow professionals/employers. Allows
discovering people in any event whom a user is interested in.

* A few possible competitors on the App Store is "vFairs", "HiHello", and Covve. They
allow people to either discover like-minded professionals or maintain digital business
cards. However, they don’t have the ability to create virtual card bowls.

* Our app will be different from our competitors. Our app won’t require professionals to
sign in to attend an event. Users can also drop their cards in bowls at events. People can
also see different bowl properties (Companies attending, Booths, Help Section) in each
bowl.

* Some review themes were describing the issues in fetching the details automatically by
clicking the snap of the card. People were also looking for bucketing or tagging their
contacts. Unwanted pop ups every time to share your business card.

* Our app is innovative through discovering people using event bowls.

* To keep people engaged in our app, will add a little bit of gamification to the app. When
the user drops their card into a bowl, they can receive trophies and coins to redeem on
points for other features in the app, like premium cards. Also, users can receive special
titles, and badges in the app when they complete some task or challenges.

* Potential weaknesses are when GPS is not working but we aim to solve this issue with
QR codes for the bowls and stick it physically to the venue in case GPS not working.
Another potential weakness is users spoofing their location, we will solve this by having
passwords for the bowls at the events if they are protected bowls.

* We think we will be able to design, test, and build out the MVP of our app before the end
of the semester.
